```

#### Installation
```bash
# NPM
npm install @ruknds/core@2.0.0

# Or use CDN
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@ruknds/core@2.0.0/components/rukn-ui.js" type="module"></script>
```

### Performance Comparison

| Library | Technology | Bundle Size (gzipped) | Relative Size |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|---------------|
| **Rukn DS 2.0** | **Vanilla JS** | **~5KB** | **1x** ⚡⚡⚡ |
| Bootstrap | jQuery | ~25KB + jQuery (~30KB) | 11x |
| Untitled UI | React | ~45KB + React (~40KB) | 17x |
| shadcn/ui | React | ~45KB + React (~40KB) | 17x |
| Material UI | React | ~80KB + React (~40KB) | 24x |

### Breaking Changes

⚠️ **None!** This is a **non-breaking upgrade**:
- All existing CSS classes still work
- No API changes to existing components
- Web Components are **additive** - use as much or as little as you want
- Gradually migrate at your own pace

### Deprecations

- **None** - All previous functionality is preserved

### Notes

This is a **major version bump** (1.x → 2.0) because we're introducing a fundamentally new paradigm (Web Components), but it's **fully backward compatible**. You can:
1. Continue using CSS-only approach
2. Migrate to Web Components gradually
3. Mix both approaches in the same project
